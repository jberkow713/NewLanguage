    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/about/index.html": "About Us\n\nAt a glance\n\nChronic diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States and the leading driver of the nation's $4.5 trillion annual health care costs. CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP) supports healthy behaviors and preventive medical care to help people prevent and manage chronic diseases.\n\nWhat we do\n\nMost preventable chronic diseases are caused by key risk behaviors:\n\nTobacco use and exposure to secondhand smoke .\n\nPoor nutrition , including diets low in fruits and vegetables and high in sodium and saturated fats.\n\nPhysical inactivity .\n\nExcessive alcohol use .\n\nThese behaviors can lead to conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity , which raise the risk of the most common and serious chronic diseases.\n\nNCCDPHP commits more than 75% of its budget to fund state, local, territorial, and tribal partners working to prevent chronic diseases in their communities. This work focuses on following evidence-based prevention strategies and addressing the nonmedical conditions that affect people's health outcomes, called the social determinants of health .\n\nPriorities\n\nWe measure how many Americans have chronic conditions and which groups are most affected\n\nNCCDPHP surveys people across the United States to collect information like whether they smoke, what they eat, how they feel day-to-day, and what health conditions they have. These large, anonymous surveys help scientists at CDC and around the world understand things like:\n\nWhich groups of people have the highest rates of chronic diseases.\n\nHow health behaviors change over time.\n\nWhat factors\u2014such as race, income, or geography\u2014are linked to poor health.\n\nWe also use other sources of health information like birth and death certificates, registries of cancer cases and deaths, and electronic medical records. Names and other personal information have been removed from these sources.\n\nGathering and studying this information is called surveillance and epidemiology. We use surveillance and epidemiology to figure out what actions will work best to reduce chronic diseases, especially in the communities most affected.\n\nExamples of surveillance and epidemiology\n\nTracking policies that affect chronic diseases, such as those related to smokefree air, access to healthy foods, and safe places to get physical activity.\n\nSurveying hospitals to find out what practices are used to prevent maternal deaths and support breastfeeding.\n\nMeasuring how many Americans get preventive health care, such as routine cancer screening and dental cleanings.\n\nMeasuring community factors that influence health, such as the number of liquor stores or tobacco retailers in an area.\n\nWe improve environments to make it easier for people to make healthy choices\n\nA person's environment can determine whether they can exercise safely, buy healthy food, or drink clean water. That's why it's one of the key social determinants of health or nonmedical drivers of health. Actions that improve environments can reach a lot of people at once which saves money and protects lives.\n\nEnvironmental approaches that work\n\nPassing smokefree air laws that cover all workplaces, restaurants, and bars to protect nonsmokers from exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nDesigning communities to encourage walking and biking.\n\nSetting up farmers' markets that accept WIC vouchers in communities without access to affordable fruits and vegetables.\n\nWe strengthen health care systems to keep people well or diagnose diseases early\n\nRoutine preventive care\u2014like blood pressure checks and cancer screenings\u2014can help people catch problems early and stay well. We work with health systems to make this kind of care more effective and available in communities across the nation.\n\nExamples of health care system interventions\n\nFunding community health workers to help people manage their conditions and resolve problems that stand in the way of getting care, like language barriers or lack of transportation.\n\nIncreasing the use of health information technology to flag patients who may have undiagnosed conditions or problems taking their medicine.\n\nExpanding the model of health care from a single doctor to a team approach, whereby other clinicians and pharmacists play an important role in helping patients keep their high blood pressure under control.\n\nWe connect clinical services to community programs\n\nCDC's work to link medical care to community resources can help people prevent or slow down chronic diseases, avoid complications, and reduce the need for more health care. Improved links between community and clinical settings often mean that clinicians can refer patients to proven programs, ideally with community organizations and other non-clinicians getting reimbursed by health insurance.\n\nExamples of community-clinical links\n\nIncreasing the use of proven community interventions\u2014such as the National Diabetes Prevention Program\u2014through clinician referrals and health insurance coverage.\n\nWorking with faith-based and tribal organizations to educate women about cancer screening and connect them to care.\n\nEducating people to become more involved in their own health care, for example, by using home blood pressure monitoring.\n\nOur impact\n\nThese efforts have led to improvements in leading health indicators like high blood pressure control, physical activity, and teen pregnancy.

The cost of managing chronic conditions is a significant portion of the nation\u2019s health care expenses. The United States has made progress in chronic disease prevention and control over recent decades. However, similar advancements have not been made in the U.S. territories and freely associated states.\n\nThe U.S. territories and freely associated states include: American Samoa, The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), Guam, Puerto Rico, the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), the Republic of Palau, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThe unique challenges these islands face make addressing chronic disease particularly complex. These challenges include:\n\nHigh disease burden.\n\nDispersed populations.\n\nLimited infrastructure.\n\nDiverse cultures and languages.\n\nVulnerability to natural disasters.\n\nStrained health care systems.\n\nHigh health care costs.\n\nGoals\n\nThis cooperative agreement will support integrated, evidence-based strategies and activities to prevent and manage chronic disease in the U.S. territories and freely associated states. This notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) aims to reduce disability and death rates associated with chronic diseases by decreasing the prevalence of modifiable risk factors that contribute to chronic diseases in these islands. Focus areas include:\n\nPreventing and reducing tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nPreventing and managing diabetes.\n\nImproving oral health disparities.\n\nThere are two components to this NOFO. The first is a required Core Component, which uses evidence-based strategies to promote health and reduce chronic disease. The second is an optional, competitive Oral Health Component , which addresses oral disease with evidence-based interventions and practices.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nSubmit your questions to islandprogdp25-0024@cdc.gov . New FAQs will be posted here weekly.\n\nWhat is the maximum allowable budget for applicants submitting a proposal for the core component only, and will a request of $550,000 disqualify their grant if they are not applying for the oral health component?\n\nYou will not be disqualified for submitting a higher budget; however, we will ask you to resubmit a revised budget if the funding is less than your request.\n\nIs it sufficient to include a section on outcomes and performance evaluation methods for the Oral Health Component, like what is done in the Core component, given that the proposal states that \"Evaluation and performance measurement criteria for Oral Health Component\" will be evaluated?\n\nThe applicant can respond to the oral health evaluation criteria like the information for the core component. The applicant must ensure their response speaks to oral health and is as detailed as possible.\n\nShould we integrate the focus population, collaborations, organizational capacity, and background related to oral health into the existing core component sections, or would it be more effective to create separate sections specifically addressing these aspects?\n\nEither approach would be acceptable.\n\nCan funds be used for direct services in oral health, or are they limited to purchasing supplies?\n\nFunds cannot be used for direct services.\n\nIs there a salary cap for an individual\u2019s position funded under this program?\n\nThe salary cap is $221,900 per individual. Congress restricts the amount of direct salary paid to an individual under an HHS grant, cooperative agreement, or applicable contract to a rate no greater than Executive Level II of the 2024 Executive Schedule Pay Table\n\nWhat is required as proof of residency for applicants?\n\nYou must provide proof of your location in one of the U.S. territories or freely associated states listed on page 9 of the NOFO.

In addition, 120 million people have high blood pressure, a major risk factor for heart disease and stroke and an increasingly common cause of pregnancy complications. Cardiovascular disease costs the health care system $251 billion every year and leads to $156 billion in lost productivity.\n\nIn addition to high blood pressure, the leading preventable risk factors for heart disease and stroke are high LDL (bad) cholesterol, smoking, poor nutrition, physical inactivity, type 2 diabetes, and obesity.\n\nDHDSP works to improve prevention and control of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, especially for groups affected by health disparities, which are differences in health across sex, geographic, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.\n\nDHDSP's newest area of focus is improving women's cardiovascular health by raising awareness of heart disease as women's number one health threat and improving control of high blood pressure, including during and following pregnancy.\n\nPriorities\n\nFund state, local, and tribal heart disease and stroke programs\n\nIn FY 2023, CDC awarded about $114 million to all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 12 tribes, 23 tribal-serving organizations, 3 large cities or counties, 3 health systems, and 4 universities to:\n\nIncrease the use of electronic health records and other technology to identify people who have heart disease and stroke risk factors and make sure they get the right treatment.\n\nIncrease the use of team-based care, in which doctors and nurses work with pharmacists, community health workers, and others outside of medical settings to manage a patient's risk factors.\n\nIncrease self-measurement of blood pressure for people with high blood pressure.\n\nRefer people to effective lifestyle programs that can help them learn to be physically active and eat nutritious foods.\n\nReduce disability and death from stroke and prevent recurrence\n\nCDC provides funding and guidance to 13 states to improve outcomes for people with and at risk for stroke through the Paul Coverdell National Acute Stroke Program . This information is used to identify gaps in care and generate solutions to improve outcomes.\n\nCDC then works with funded states to improve care at every stage\u2014from the first symptoms through ambulance transport, hospitalization, post-stroke care, and discharge to home\u2014and to increase awareness of the signs and symptoms of stroke.\n\nScreen women for heart disease and stroke and refer those at risk to lifestyle interventions\n\nThe WISEWOMAN (Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for WOMen Across the Nation) program works to reduce heart disease and stroke risk factors for women aged 35 to 64 years with low incomes and little or no health insurance. The program aims to help women understand and reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease and benefit from early detection and treatment.\n\nWISEWOMAN consists of 35 recipients in 32 states, 2 tribal organizations, and 1 US-Affiliated Pacific Island that offer preventive health services to women who participate in the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program .\n\nThe program's preventive services include blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes screenings. Women are counseled about their risk of heart disease and stroke and referred to lifestyle programs and other community resources that can help them control their blood pressure, eat a healthier diet, be physically active, and quit smoking.\n\nPrevent heart attacks and strokes through Million Hearts\n\nMillion Hearts \u00ae is a national initiative co-led by CDC and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with a goal of preventing 1 million heart attacks and strokes within 5 years. It focuses on a small set of priorities selected for their ability to reduce heart disease, stroke, and related conditions:\n\nReduce tobacco use, physical inactivity, and exposure to air pollution.\n\nImprove the ABCS of cardiovascular health (Aspirin or Anticoagulant use as appropriate, Blood pressure control, Cholesterol management, Smoking cessation).\n\nIncrease the use of cardiac rehabilitation among people who have had a qualifying event like a heart attack or coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\nMillion Hearts \u00ae 2027 recognizes that heart disease and stroke are more common in populations that have a hard time being healthy because of conditions where they live, learn, work, and play. In response, it has developed specific policies, processes, and practices to address these social determinants of health .\n\nRead more: Million Hearts Hypertension Control success stories .\n\nOur impact\n\nFrom 2018 to 2022, health systems partnering with funded states improved blood pressure control rates by 5%, even as the pandemic worsened cardiovascular health nationwide.\n\nThe Coverdell Program has improved stroke care for over 1.1 million patients in over 800 hospitals. Patients receiving timely delivery of the life-saving drug tPA in Coverdell hospitals more than doubled, from 29% in 2008 to 71% in 2021.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2022, WISEWOMAN provided 365,440 screenings to 256,442 participants and provided nearly 502,000 healthy behavior support services to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.\n\nFor more than 8 years, Million Hearts\u00ae and the National Association of Community Health Centers have trained more than 1,400 clinicians and developed more than 50 tools and resources. These efforts have helped more than 700,000 patients lower their risk for heart attack or stroke by improving the control of high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Wright leads the Division for Heart Disease and Stroke Prevention.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

We envision a future where all young people are empowered with the knowledge, skills, and resources to support their health and well-being.\n\nWhat we do\n\nIn the United States, schools reach more than 50 million students in grades K\u201312, providing a unique opportunity to support nearly all young people and improve their mental, physical, and behavioral health. DASH works to:\n\nImprove child and adolescent access to quality health and physical education, school-based health services, and school environments that support health and well-being, with additional attention on health disparities.\n\nImprove data collection and dissemination to help schools and educators make informed decisions to support adolescent health.\n\nUse data and science to drive action to address the most important issues among young people, including the current mental health crisis. Schools are on the frontlines of this crisis and are critical partners in addressing it.\n\nPriorities\n\nDASH supports state and local education agencies to promote school health policies and practices that improve students' health and well-being.\n\nCDC's What Works in Schools program equips schools with the tools and resources to provide quality health education, connect students to health services, and create safe and supportive environments. For less than $10 per student per year, CDC supports school districts in using this prevention program.\n\nCDC's Healthy Schools program brings together the education and public health sectors to support chronic disease prevention. This approach strengthens coalitions to support the use of evidence-based strategies that help students eat well, get more physical activity, and manage their chronic conditions.\n\nStarting as early as possible with approaches like these can help prevent the most serious risks to health and well-being.\n\nOur impact\n\nThe What Works in Schools program improved students' mental health and reduced substance use, sexual risk behavior, and experiences of violence.\n\nCDC-funded school districts have seen significant declines in the percentage of students who engaged in sexual risk behavior, used substances like marijuana, and experienced violence like forced sex.\n\nIn states funded to implement the Healthy Schools Program, schools were less likely to sell less healthy foods and beverages, used practices to increase physical activity, and provided case management for students with chronic health conditions.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Underwood leads the Division of Adolescent and School Health.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

Cancer is the nation's second leading cause of death, but more than half of cancer deaths could likely be prevented by reducing causes of cancer and increasing screening and vaccinations.\n\nDCPC works to reduce factors that increase cancer risk and promotes cancer screenings. These activities help every person have an equal opportunity to achieve the best health possible.\n\nPriorities\n\nCollect data on cancer cases and treatment\n\nDCPC runs the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and coordinates with other federal agencies to collect data on nearly all cancer cases in the United States. These data are used to help guide efforts to prevent cancer and catch it early.\n\nNPCR data can be used to answer questions such as:\n\nAre more or fewer people getting colon cancer this year compared to last year?\n\nAre women in certain geographic areas more likely to have breast cancer at a late stage, when it's harder to treat?\n\nWhat groups of people are most likely to get skin cancer?\n\nRead more: Cancer Registries in Action\n\nPromote colorectal cancer screening\n\nColorectal cancer is a leading cancer killer in the United States, but it doesn't have to be. Colorectal cancer screening can find precancerous polyps\u2014abnormal growths in the colon or rectum\u2014so they can be removed before turning into cancer. Screening also helps find colorectal cancer at an early stage, when treatment works best.\n\nCDC's Colorectal Cancer Control Program funds 20 states, 8 universities, 2 tribal organizations, and 5 other organizations to increase colorectal cancer screening rates for people aged 45 to 75.\n\nPromote breast and cervical cancer screening\n\nGetting mammograms, Pap tests, and human papillomavirus (HPV) tests regularly can lower the risk of dying of breast or cervical cancer. These tests help find cancer early, when treatment works best. Cervical cancer screening tests can also prevent cancer by finding precancerous lesions (abnormal growths) before they turn into cancer.\n\nCDC's National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, 5 US-Affiliated Pacific Islands, and 13 tribes or tribal organizations. These programs provide breast and cervical cancer screening and diagnostic services to women with low incomes and little or no health insurance. Women who are diagnosed with cancer through the NBCCEDP may qualify for treatment through Medicaid.\n\nRead more: Enhancing Clinical Services for Patients\n\nFund states to prevent and control cancer\n\nCDC's National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) funds all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 7 US territories and freely associated states, and 7 tribes or tribal organizations to:\n\nBuild groups of partners that share resources and expertise to fight cancer.\n\nUse data from cancer registries, behavioral risk factor surveys, and other sources to learn which cancers and risk factors affect their communities most.\n\nImprove access to screening and treatment.\n\nReduce cancer risk factors and improve cancer outcomes for groups affected by health disparities.\n\nRespond to the physical, financial, and emotional needs of cancer survivors and their families.\n\nRead more: NCCCP Success Stories\n\nHelp educate people about cancer\n\nThe Bring Your Brave campaign educates women younger than 45 about breast cancer. The campaign shares real stories to inspire young women to learn their risk of breast cancer and talk with their doctor about how to reduce it.\n\nCDC's Inside Knowledge About Gynecologic Cancer campaign raises awareness among women and medical professionals about the five main types of gynecologic cancer: cervical, ovarian, uterine, vaginal, and vulvar.\n\nThe Screen for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign raises awareness of the importance of screening for colorectal cancer.\n\nOur impact\n\nSince 1991, NBCCEDP-funded programs have provided more than 16 million breast and cervical cancer screening tests. These tests have found nearly 78,000 breast cancers and more than 5,000 cervical cancers.\n\nThe NCCCP brings together organizations to create plans that help lower the number of people affected by cancer.

The division works to identify people with prediabetes, prevent type 2 diabetes, prevent diabetes complications, and improve the health of all people with diabetes.\n\nWhat we do\n\nIn the last 20 years, the number of adults diagnosed with diabetes has more than doubled as the American population has aged and become more overweight or obese.\n\nMore than 38 million people in the United States have diabetes, and 98 million U.S. adults\u2014over a third\u2014have prediabetes . Diabetes is the 8 th leading cause of death and may be underreported. Medical costs and lost work and wages for people with diagnosed diabetes total $413 billion yearly.\n\nDDT focuses on programs and policies that help people prevent type 2 diabetes and improve the health of everyone living with diabetes. DDT also works to address health inequities to reduce diabetes-related disparities (differences in health across different geographic, racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups).\n\nPriorities\n\nMeasure the burden of diabetes and translate data into effective programs\n\nDDT collects, studies, and shares information to assess the burden of diabetes, helps guide public health funding and policy decisions, and measures progress toward prevention goals. For example:\n\nThe U.S. Diabetes Surveillance System collects information on new and existing cases of diabetes, risk factors, care practices, and related complications at county, state, and national levels.\n\nThe Kidney Disease Surveillance System tracks kidney disease (a serious diabetes complication) and its risk factors over time and monitors progress in prevention, detection, and management.\n\nThe third phase of the Natural Experiments for Translation in Diabetes (NEXT-D3) study evaluates how real-world policies and programs can influence disparities in diabetes prevention and care.\n\nHelp people understand diabetes, their prediabetes risk, and how to prevent type 2 diabetes\n\nPrediabetes causes long-term health risks but usually has no symptoms. Though awareness of prediabetes nearly tripled among U.S. adults with the condition from 2005 to 2020, most of the 98 million who have prediabetes still do not know they have it.\n\nIn partnership with the American Medical Association and the Ad Council, DDT leads the award-winning Do I Have Prediabetes? campaign . This campaign, delivered in English and Spanish, is the first ever to raise awareness about prediabetes across the nation. The campaign reaches millions of people and encourages them to take a 1-minute test at DoIHavePrediabetes.org to better understand their possible risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe campaign website also links to organizations delivering the National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) lifestyle change program, proven to help reverse prediabetes and prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in people at high risk.\n\nHelp prevent type 2 diabetes in people at risk\n\nThe CDC-led National DPP delivers an affordable, evidence-based lifestyle change program to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes.\n\nWorking with a trained Lifestyle Coach, program participants learn to make better food choices, lose weight, be more physically active, and find ways to cope with problems and stress during the yearlong program. These lifestyle changes can cut their risk of developing type 2 diabetes by as much as 58% (71% for those over 60). The program is delivered in person, online, by distance learning, or in a combination of formats.\n\nCDC is committed to increasing access to the National DPP among populations most at risk, including those living in rural areas. Through telehealth, underserved populations can participate in the lifestyle change program by phone, smartphone app, computer, text, and video.\n\nHelp people with diabetes improve their health and quality of life\n\nDDT works to increase access to diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) services, which help people manage daily diabetes care\u2014eating healthy food, being active, checking blood sugar, taking prescribed medications, and handling stress.\n\nDSMES has been shown to lower A1C levels, prevent or lessen diabetes complications, and improve quality of life. These services can also lower medical expenses for people with diabetes and reduce the cost of diabetes to the U.S. health care system.\n\nRural populations have higher rates of diabetes compared to people who live in urban areas, but 62% of rural counties have limited DSMES services. The use of telehealth\u2014delivery of services by phone, Internet, or videoconference\u2014allows more patients in rural areas to benefit from DSMES.\n\nCDC funds state and local health departments to improve access to, participation in, and health benefit coverage for DSMES.\n\nFund partners to prevent type 2 diabetes and diabetes complications\n\nCDC supports partners to:\n\nImprove prediabetes awareness among health care providers and people at risk.\n\nIncrease access to and enrollment in the National DPP lifestyle change program , and increase coverage among public and private payers and employers.\n\nImprove prediabetes screening, testing, and referral to the lifestyle change program.\n\nIncrease DSMES access, participation, and health benefit coverage.\n\nIncrease use of community health workers, pharmacists, and registered dietitians to support type 2 diabetes prevention and DSMES services.\n\nPartner with health care organizations to improve diabetes quality of care.\n\nOur impact\n\nStudies show that awareness of risk is a critical first step in changing health behaviors. As of January 2024, the Do I Have Prediabetes? awareness campaign has resulted in 12.8 million online and video prediabetes risk test completions. In addition, nearly 270,000 visits have been made to the National DPP site to find a lifestyle change program location.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Holliday leads the Division of Diabetes Translation.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

These investments advance public health strategies that prevent chronic diseases related to diet and inactivity to protect the health of people across the nation.\n\nWhat we do\n\nPoor nutrition and inadequate physical activity are significant risk factors for obesity and other chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and heart disease. They can also contribute to stroke, certain cancers, and depression. In the United States:\n\nLess than 1 in 10 children and adults eat the recommended daily amount of vegetables .\n\nOnly 1 in 4 adults and 1 in 6 young people fully meet physical activity guidelines .\n\n2 in 10 children and 4 in 10 adults have obesity.\n\nDNPAO focuses on supporting breastfeeding, promoting a healthy childhood, improving nutrition, increasing physical activity, preventing and reducing obesity, and achieving health equity by reducing disparities. DNPAO experts add to scientific evidence that guides public health practices and make timely, relevant data available to monitor public health outcomes and progress.\n\nPriorities\n\nMake breastfeeding easier to start and continue\n\nBreastfeeding is the best first source of nutrition for most infants, and it can reduce the risk of some health conditions for both infants and mothers. Although more than 80% of mothers start out breastfeeding, about 60% stop sooner than they planned.\n\nLow rates of breastfeeding add more than $3 billion a year to medical costs for women and children in the United States.\n\nDNPAO promotes breastfeeding and infant and toddler nutrition practices by:\n\nEmpowering mothers who want to breastfeed get the support they need while in the hospital and once they return home. DNPAO helps hospitals improve maternity care practices that support breastfeeding.\n\nMeasuring progress on hospital support for breastfeeding by conducting the national Maternity Practices in Infant Nutrition and Care (mPINC) survey .\n\nImproving continuity of care throughout communities with low breastfeeding rates. DNPAO promotes consistent, collaborative, and seamless delivery of high-quality services from the prenatal period until families are no longer breastfeeding.\n\nSharing resources to provide parents and caregivers with information about infant formula feeding and introducing healthy foods and beverages to support good nutrition.\n\nPromote a healthy childhood\n\nGood nutrition and physical activity are vital for healthy growth and development. In contrast, poor nutrition and low levels of physical activity contribute to childhood obesity. Many settings influence a child's diet and physical activity, including their home, childcare centers, schools, communities, and clinics.\n\nDNPAO investments help to improve nutrition and physical activity for children by:\n\nPromoting best practices in nutrition, breastfeeding, screen time, and physical activity in early care and education (ECE) settings by helping states improve policies and programs to meet obesity prevention standards in ECEs.\n\nHelping communities create safe places for children to walk and play.\n\nWorking with health care and community partners to increase availability of and access to family healthy weight programs .\n\nMake healthy food choices easier everywhere\n\nPeople with healthy eating patterns live longer and have healthier lives. However, many groups have limited access to affordable, healthy foods such as fruits and vegetables. These groups include people living in rural areas, tribal communities, and neighborhoods where most residents have lower incomes. People with disabilities may also be affected. In addition, people in some racial and ethnic groups may not have access to culturally preferred healthy foods.\n\nDNPAO expertise and funding help states, communities, and national partners to increase healthy food and beverage options by:\n\nWorking with partners to use food service or nutrition guidelines and tools to increase access to nutritious food options in community settings, such as hospitals and food pantries.\n\nSupporting expansion of existing fruit and vegetable voucher incentive and produce prescription programs to improve affordability and access to healthier food.\n\nUsing data to track nutrition behaviors among U.S. children and adults.\n\nMake physical activity safe and accessible for all\n\nPhysical activity can help protect health and prevent or improve many health conditions, including many of the leading causes of death in the United States. Other potential benefits include better school performance, improved mental health, healthier aging, and improved military readiness. Inadequate physical activity costs the nation $117 billion a year for related health care.\n\nUnfortunately, many Americans live in communities that lack safe, convenient places to be physically active. In response, DNPAO launched Active People, Healthy Nation SM to help 27 million Americans become more physically active by 2027. Through this initiative, DNPAO:\n\nPartners with state and local governments to promote equitable improvements in community design that make physical activity and active transportation safer and more convenient for everyone.\n\nEducates the public about the health benefits of physical activity and tracks how much physical activity young people and adults are getting.\n\nInvest in states and communities\n\nThe State Physical Activity and Nutrition Program (SPAN) funds 17 states to use interventions that support good nutrition, safe and accessible physical activity, healthy ECE environments, and breastfeeding. SPAN recipients work to reduce or eliminate health disparities related to poor nutrition, physical inactivity, and obesity.\n\nThe High Obesity Program (HOP) funds 16 universities to work with community extension services to increase access to nutritious foods, safe and accessible physical activity, family healthy weight programs, and healthy ECE environments in counties where more than 40% of the adult population has obesity.\n\nRacial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health (REACH) is at the forefront of CDC's efforts to achieve health for everyone across the United States, with a special focus on populations that experience health disparities . REACH funds 50 state and local organizations to reduce health disparities among racial and ethnic groups. Recipients work in communities with high risk or rates of chronic diseases, such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity. Recipients use culturally tailored interventions to increase access to:\n\nNutritious foods\n\nSafe and accessible physical activity\n\nBreastfeeding information, knowledge, and support\n\nHealthy ECE environments\n\nFamily healthy weight programs\n\nTobacco-free environments\n\nRoutine adult vaccinations\n\nOur impact\n\nFrom 2018 to 2023, SPAN, REACH, and HOP program recipients potentially benefited:\n\nMore than 28 million people through increased access to places where they can be physically active.\n\nMore than 9 million people through increased access to nutritious foods.\n\nMore than 3.8 million children through improved ECE environments.\n\nMore than 3 million people through community support to start and continue breastfeeding.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Petersen leads the Division of Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",
    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/divisions-offices/about-the-division-of-oral-health.html": "About the Division of Oral Health\n\nAt a glance\n\nCDC's Division of Oral Health (DOH) provides leadership and promotes proven interventions to improve the nation's oral health.\n\nWhat we do\n\nGood oral health allows us to eat, speak, smile, and show emotions. It affects self-esteem, school performance, and attendance at work and school. Oral diseases\u2014which range from cavities to gum disease to oral cancers\u2014cause pain and disability for millions of people in the United States.\n\nIn the United States, over half (52%) of children aged 6 to 8 years have had a cavity in their primary (baby) teeth. About 1 in 4 adults have untreated cavities. Almost half of adults over 30 show signs of gum disease.\n\nStudies have shown that about 34 million school hours and 92 million work hours are lost yearly due to unplanned and emergency dental care, and roughly $46 billion in productivity (2015 US dollars) is lost yearly due to untreated oral diseases.\n\nDOH supports state and territorial oral health programs, collects data on oral diseases, develops infection prevention and control guidelines for dental settings, and trains future dental public health specialists. The division also supports strategies to advance medical-dental integration and whole-person care.\n\nPriorities\n\nCollecting data to monitor progress in oral health\n\nDOH analyzes data to monitor progress in meeting Healthy People 2030 oral health objectives , one of which is to increase use of the oral health care system.\n\nThe division maintains Oral Health Data , an online system that brings together information from various local, state, and national data sources, which users can export to create tables, charts, and maps.\n\nDOH also helps state health departments collect, interpret, and share their local and state data on oral health status and the use of preventive services so they can understand where to direct their resources.\n\nPromoting optimal use of community water fluoridation to reduce cavities\n\nCommunity water fluoridation is recognized as one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century. Even with the widespread use of fluoride products, like toothpaste, studies have found that people living in communities with water fluoridation have about 25% fewer cavities than those without fluoridation.\n\nDOH works with state and national partners to optimize the use of water fluoridation by training state drinking water system engineers, state oral health program staff, and public health staff. DOH created Fluoridation Learning Online , an interactive resource that provides thousands of water operators with training at their own pace.\n\nThe division also manages an online reporting system that helps states monitor the quality of their water fluoridation programs. The public side of this database, My Water's Fluoride , allows residents in participating states to learn the fluoride content of their public water system.\n\nPromoting school sealant programs to prevent cavities\n\nOne in five children aged 6 to 11 years has at least one untreated cavity, which can lead to problems eating, speaking, and learning. Dental sealants protect against 80% of cavities for 2 years and continue to protect against 50% of cavities for up to 4 years. Children aged 6 to 11 without sealants have almost 3 times more first molar cavities than children with sealants.\n\nSchool sealant programs provide dental sealants at no charge to children who are less likely to receive private dental care. These programs provide sealants at school during the school day using mobile dental equipment. As a result, sealant use has increased substantially among children from low-income families, greatly reducing the disparity between them and children from higher-income families. However, this effective intervention remains underused; less than half of all children aged 6 to 11 have dental sealants.\n\nDOH provides guidance to state and community programs to help them plan, set up, and evaluate school sealant programs. The division's SEALS application allows state and local programs to evaluate the effectiveness of their school sealant programs.\n\nPreventing infections in dental care settings through guidelines and training\n\nDental health care settings must meet the same high standards for infection prevention and control as any medical setting. To help reduce the risk of disease transmission, DOH develops recommendations to guide infection prevention and control practices in all dental treatment settings.\n\nThe DOH resource, Summary of Infection Prevention Practices in Dental Settings: Basic Expectations for Safe Care , highlights the key recommendations that guide infection prevention practices in dental offices nationally and globally.\n\nDOH also offers resources to promote adherence to these guidelines, including the mobile app CDC DentalCheck , fact sheets, and training materials such as Foundations: Building the Safest Dental Visit , an online, self-paced training that offers free dental continuing education credit hours to individual learners.\n\nSupporting programs and partners to improve oral health\n\nDOH provides 20 states and 1 territory with funds, technical assistance, and training to build strong oral health programs. This support helps recipients promote oral health, monitor oral health behaviors and problems, and conduct and evaluate prevention programs. It also helps recipients better coordinate community water fluoridation and school sealant programs and develop ways to better integrate dental and medical care at the state and local levels.\n\nAt the national level, DOH works with other chronic disease programs to promote prevention strategies designed to reduce risk factors associated with multiple chronic conditions, like gum disease.\n\nDOH runs a Dental Public Health Residency Program, which produces skilled specialists to collaborate with their public health and dental colleagues in an array of health settings to improve oral health at the population level.\n\nOur impact\n\nMore than 209 million people, representing 72.7% of the population, are served by community water systems that provide water with enough fluoride to prevent cavities.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Thornton-Evans leads the Division of Oral Health.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

We do this by collecting data, conducting community-based research, and developing cross-cutting public health programs.\n\nPriorities\n\nMaking data available to drive public health progress\n\nDPH delivers timely, high-quality health data to help communities and states better understand the prevalence and geographic distribution of health measures, which can be helpful in planning public health programs that best meet the needs of their populations.\n\nThe Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) collects state data about health behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services among U.S. adults. BRFSS is the largest telephone health survey in the world and captures information from more than 400,000 U.S. adults each year across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and participating U.S. territories. The BRFSS online tool allows users to display data for state-to-state and state-to-national comparisons.\n\nPLACES: Local Data for Better Health provides health data for small areas (counties, census tracts, and ZIP code tabulation areas) across the country.\n\nThe Chronic Disease Indicators tool provides national and state estimates for 113 surveillance indicators of chronic diseases and their risk factors. Where applicable, estimates are broken down by sex, race and ethnicity, and age group.\n\nTranslating research for public health impact\n\nSince 1984, CDC has funded the Prevention Research Centers (PRCs), a network of academic research centers that study how people and their communities can reduce risk factors for chronic conditions, such as heart disease, obesity, and cancer. PRCs work with local communities to develop, test, and evaluate solutions to public health problems.\n\nFor example, to improve access to community health workers (CHWs), the University of Arizona PRC (AzPRC) partnered with other local public health organizations to achieve a state certification path for CHWs. They first established the Arizona CHW Workforce Coalition, which worked with legislators to formalize voluntary CHW certification. Then they developed tools to share AzPRC's research with decision makers and identified sustainable funding mechanisms to integrate CHWs into the health care system.\n\nProviding scientific and programmatic expertise\n\nTribal health\n\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) adults have higher rates of some chronic diseases and lower life expectancy\u2014about 11 years lower\u2014than other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. With DPH's culture-first approach, the Healthy Tribes Program funds tribes, villages, tribal organizations, and Tribal Epidemiology Centers through three programs:\n\nGood Health and Wellness in Indian Country . Recipients implement a coordinated and holistic approach to reduce chronic disease risk factors in Native communities.\n\nTribal Practices for Wellness in Indian Country (TPWIC). Recipients implement tribal practices and cultural traditions to strengthen community and cultural connections for improved physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health and well-being within AI/AN communities. From 2018 through 2022, TPWIC engaged over 250,000 AI/AN community members in diet, nutrition, physical activity, cooking, and gardening activities that promote healthy living.\n\nTribal Epidemiology Centers Public Health Infrastructure . Recipients work to address data gaps and build public health capacity to promote health and prevent disease in AI/AN communities.\n\nHealthy aging: Alzheimer's disease and arthritis\n\nDPH focuses on two challenges to the health and quality of life of aging adults today: Alzheimer's disease and arthritis.\n\nAlzheimer's disease is the most common form of dementia and the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. It affects 6.9 million U.S. adults, a number that is expected to double by 2060.\n\nCDC promotes awareness and strategies to address Alzheimer's disease and related dementias through the National Healthy Brain Initiative and Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) infrastructure activities. BOLD funds 43 public health department programs and 3 BOLD Public Health Centers of Excellence to:\n\nIncrease early detection and diagnosis.\n\nReduce risk.\n\nPrevent avoidable hospitalizations.\n\nSupport caregiving for people with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.\n\nArthritis affects 1 in 5 adults, or over 54 million people, in the United States. 1 It is a major cause of disability and pain for adults, and the top reason for work disability in this country.\n\nCDC's Arthritis Well-Being and Management Program works to improve the quality of life for people with arthritis by:\n\nCollecting data to identify arthritis trends.\n\nConducting research to learn how arthritis affects quality of life for people who also have other chronic diseases (like diabetes).\n\nFunding 12 states and 5 national organizations to expand the reach of proven physical activity and self-management education programs.\n\nFunding 3 universities as part of a new arthritis research network.\n\nSince 2012, in collaboration with states and national partners, CDC has reached more than 200,000 adults with evidence-based interventions that can improve arthritis management and quality of life.\n\nSocial determinants of health\n\nNot all people have the same opportunities for health and wellness. Some groups have much higher rates of chronic diseases as a result of different environmental, policy, structural, or social conditions. CDC funds programs to address nonmedical factors that influence health in five priority areas:\n\nBuilt environment.\n\nCommunity-clinical linkages.\n\nFood and nutrition security.\n\nSocial connectedness.\n\nTobacco-free policies.\n\nSince 2021, CDC has funded 71 states, communities, and territories to develop Accelerator Plans addressing the five priorities. These plans are intended to accelerate action in state, local, territorial, and tribal jurisdictions that lead to improved chronic disease outcomes for groups affected by health disparities and inequities.\n\nCDC is also funding five ACTion states and communities to implement established plans to address SDOH in their communities by increasing access to clinical services, safe places to be active, healthy foods, and social services.\n\nExcessive alcohol use\n\nExcessive alcohol use, including underage drinking and binge drinking, is responsible for more than 178,000 deaths per year in the United States. Among adults aged 20 to 49, about 1 in 5 deaths are from excessive drinking. Excessive alcohol use increases the risk of injuries, violence, and chronic diseases (such as liver diseases, several types of cancer, and high blood pressure).\n\nCDC's Alcohol Program funds 11 states to promote strategies that reduce alcohol-related illness, injury, and deaths. The program:\n\nMeasures the effects of excessive alcohol use on groups of people.\n\nWorks with partners to provide resources and expand the use of effective strategies in states and communities.\n\nCommunicates the benefits of reducing excessive alcohol use .\n\nExpands the ability of states to monitor patterns of alcohol use and related health effects.\n\nInvestigating emerging public health topics for better awareness\n\nEpilepsy\n\nAbout 3.3 million Americans have epilepsy , including 456,000 children. Epilepsy and seizures cost the nation at least $24.5 billion per year in medical costs.\n\nEpilepsy can have both direct and indirect health effects that limit life opportunities and access to timely and effective treatment. For example, people with epilepsy may have uncontrolled seizures, need frequent in-hospital care, be unable to drive, and face stigma and discrimination. As a result, they may have trouble with school, jobs, and relationships, and may have depression and anxiety.\n\nCDC's Managing Epilepsy Well Network has collaborated with more than 35 epilepsy health or social service partners across the United States to expand the reach of proven epilepsy self-management programs through in-person and virtual offerings. These programs help people with epilepsy take control of their health and manage their day-to-day challenges.\n\nLupus\n\nLupus is an incurable autoimmune disease that triggers inflammation, causing pain and affecting daily life. It can affect people of all ages, including children, but women aged 15 to 44 and those from minority racial and ethnic groups are most at risk.\n\nCDC funds research to improve the diagnosis and treatment of lupus by funding lupus patient registries and long-term studies.\n\nIn 2023, with CDC's support, the Lupus Foundation of America's Partners United for Sustainable Lupus Education and Awareness (PULSE) project launched a campaign to help people with lupus get diagnosed more quickly and an app to promote access to lupus self-management programs. Since their launch, both initiatives have seen tremendous success, with nearly 17 million campaign views and over 3,200 app downloads.\n\nInflammatory bowel disease and interstitial cystitis\n\nCDC also funds partners to provide expertise, education, and data on chronic conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and interstitial cystitis .\n\nChronic disease education\n\nChronic Disease Education and Awareness projects fund recipients to strengthen the science base for prevention, education, and public health awareness for less known and addressed conditions.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Thomas leads the Division of Population Health.\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics.

Each year in the United States, too many women die of pregnancy-related causes, and even more women have severe pregnancy complications. One in 10 infants (about 380,000) are born prematurely, and 3,400 are lost to sudden unexpected infant death. DRH works to reduce the risk and improve the health of women and infants.\n\nPriorities\n\nUnderstand maternal mortality\n\nToo many women die each year in the United States from complications of pregnancy. Among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Black, and American Indian/Alaska Native women, the risk of dying from these complications is 2 to 4 times the risk among White women. More and better data can help us understand how to prevent pregnancy-related deaths, ensure the best possible birth outcomes, and work to achieve equity.\n\nCDC's Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System conducts national surveillance of pregnancy-related deaths in the United States. The Enhancing Reviews and Surveillance to Eliminate Maternal Mortality (ERASE MM) program supports agencies and organizations that coordinate and manage Maternal Mortality Review Committees (MMRCs).\n\nMMRCs are multidisciplinary committees in states and cities that perform comprehensive reviews of deaths among women during and within a year of the end of a pregnancy. Currently, CDC supports MMRCs in 44 states and 2 territories. Data from MMRCs provide a deeper understanding of the circumstances surrounding each death to guide recommendations at the patient, provider, facility, system, and community level for preventing future deaths.\n\nThe Maternal Mortality Review Information Application is a data system that provides a standardized approach to collect information, review deaths, and analyze data across MMRCs.\n\nThe Hear Her \u00ae campaign supports CDC's efforts to prevent pregnancy-related deaths by amplifying the stories of women who have experienced pregnancy-related complications and sharing potentially life-saving messages about urgent warning signs . Hear Her encourages health care professionals and the people supporting a pregnant or postpartum woman to really listen and take action when she expresses concerns.\n\nThe campaign develops and shares culturally appropriate, audience-focused resources and supports local implementation by tribal organizations, and community-based organizations.\n\nImprove the quality of care for mothers and infants\n\nCDC's Perinatal Quality Collaboratives (PQCs) are state or multistate networks of health care teams working to improve the quality of care for mothers and infants. They do so by advancing best practices in the health care setting and expanding successful interventions statewide. These efforts have contributed to important improvements in health care delivery and perinatal outcomes.\n\nCDC supports 36 state PQCs and funds the National Network of Perinatal Quality Collaboratives . This network provides support, mentoring, and resources for all PQCs to identify and share best practices and develop tools and training. Every US state has a PQC or is developing one.\n\nCollect quality data on women and infants\n\nThe Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) has been a critical source of data on maternal and infant health for almost 40 years. Currently, 50 jurisdictions, including 46 states, the District of Columbia, New York City, Puerto Rico, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, participate in PRAMS.\n\nPRAMS collects jurisdiction-based population data on maternal attitudes, experiences, and health before, during, and shortly after pregnancy. These data are used to guide public health action and provide insights into which efforts can best support new initiatives to improve maternal and infant health.\n\nPrevent sudden unexpected infant deaths\n\nSudden unexpected infant death (SUID) is a term used to describe the sudden and unexpected death of an infant less than 1 year old in which the cause was not clear before investigation. These deaths often happen while the infant was sleeping in an unsafe sleep environment. Every year in the United States, about 3,400 infants are lost to SUID.\n\nCDC supports surveillance programs in 32 areas of the country, which covers about 2 in 5 SUID cases in the United States. The SUID and Sudden Death in the Young (SDY) Case Registry standardizes and improves data collected at death scenes and promotes consistent reporting and classification of SUID and SDY cases. A better understanding of the circumstances and events associated with SUID and sleep-related infant deaths may help reduce future deaths.\n\nCDC publishes materials to help parents and doctors learn how to reduce the risk of SUID. The agency also collaborates on the Safe to Sleep \u00ae campaign led by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nOur impact\n\nIn 2022, CDC released the first data from the MMRCs since the ERASE MM program began. Findings from 36 state MMRCs showed that pregnancy-related deaths occurred during pregnancy, delivery, and up to a year postpartum. The leading cause of pregnancy-related death varied by maternal race and ethnicity, and over 80% of deaths were determined to be preventable.\n\nOver the first 7 months of the Hear Her campaign, people who were aware of Hear Her messages were more likely to seek information or talk to their health care providers, according to internet survey. Knowing the warning signs and getting an accurate and timely diagnosis could help save lives.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Barfield leads CDC's Division of Reproductive Health\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",
    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/divisions-offices/about-the-office-on-smoking-and-health.html": "About the Office on Smoking and Health\n\nAt a glance\n\nCDC's Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) is the lead federal agency for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control. OSH saves lives and money by preventing and reducing the use of commercial tobacco products\u2014the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States.\n\nWhat we do\n\nNote: When CDC refers to tobacco on this web page, we are referring to the use of commercial tobacco products and not the sacred and traditional use of tobacco by some American Indian communities.\n\nCommercial tobacco use accounts for about 1 in 5 deaths. Each year, nearly half a million U.S. adults, including those exposed to secondhand smoke, die early from smoking-related disease.\n\nAbout 2 in 10 U.S. adults in 2021 currently used any tobacco product. About 1 in 10 U.S. middle and high school students in 2023 currently used any tobacco product.\n\nSmoking harms nearly every organ of the body. Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other chronic health conditions. Exposure to secondhand smoke affects 1 in 4 people in the United States who don't smoke. It causes serious health problems for children and adults.\n\nSmoking-related illness cost the United States more than $600 billion in 2018. This cost includes more than $240 billion in health care spending and nearly $372 billion in lost productivity.\n\nSome groups of people are more affected by tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure, and tobacco-related health problems. They may also have less access to treatment to help them quit. Most people who use tobacco products want to quit.\n\nOSH works to:\n\nPrevent adolescents and young adults from starting to use tobacco.\n\nHelp people who use tobacco quit.\n\nEliminate exposure to secondhand smoke.\n\nAdvance health equity by eliminating inequities and disparities related to tobacco use.\n\nPriorities\n\nMeasure tobacco use and translate data into effective action\n\nCDC promotes evidence-based approaches to prevent and control tobacco use. To measure progress toward its goals, CDC collects, studies, and shares information on tobacco use and its effects on health. CDC uses this information to:\n\nMonitor changes and trends in the use of tobacco products among young people and adults.\n\nUnderstand tobacco-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors among young people and adults.\n\nPromote comprehensive tobacco control programs and policies.\n\nAnswer important questions about tobacco use and tobacco control.\n\nMeasure how tobacco use affects population groups to eliminate health disparities and advance health equity.\n\nCDC shares information in high-quality reports, easy-to-understand web resources , and interactive data applications. The Tobacco Use Data Portal provides access to the latest tobacco prevention and control data, graphs, and maps. Users can download this information for more analysis. The STATE System provides data on state tobacco use prevention and control policies.\n\nSupport comprehensive tobacco control programs\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, CDC provided over $96 million to:\n\n50 states and the District of Columbia\n\n8 US territories and freely associated states\n\n26 tribes or tribal organizations\n\n9 national networks, and several other organizations\n\nThese funds supported their efforts to reduce tobacco-related diseases, disabilities, and deaths.\n\nStates that have made larger investments in comprehensive tobacco control programs have seen larger and faster declines in cigarette smoking among adults and young people. For every $1 spent on comprehensive tobacco control programs, states get a $55 return on investment, mostly in averted health care costs to treat smoking-related illness.\n\nHelp people understand the dangers of smoking\n\nFor every American who dies because of smoking, at least 30 are living with a serious smoking-related illness. Hard-hitting media campaigns raise awareness about the dangers of smoking and motivate people to quit.\n\nCDC's Tips From Former Smokers \u00ae ( Tips \u00ae ) campaign encourages people who smoke to quit. Tips features real people from diverse backgrounds living with serious long-term health effects from smoking and secondhand smoke exposure. They share the impact smoking has had on their lives\u2014and the lives of their loved ones.\n\nTips connects people who smoke with resources to help them quit, including 1-800-QUIT-NOW. This resource links callers to their state quitline, as well as web-based, text-based, and app-based cessation support resources.\n\nRead more: Tips Impact and Results .\n\nHelp all people quit using tobacco products\n\nCDC helps people quit using tobacco products by promoting free quitlines and other support services . CDC works with health insurers, health care providers, and employers to:\n\nIncrease coverage of proven tobacco cessation treatments.\n\nEncourage tobacco-free workplace policies.\n\nPromote health system changes encourage counseling and medicines for patients who want to quit.\n\nHelp all people understand the risks of youth tobacco use\n\nYouth tobacco product use is unsafe. Nearly all tobacco product use begins during youth and young adulthood. Nicotine is highly addictive and can harm brain development, which continues into the early to mid-20s.\n\nCigarette smoking is decreasing among young people; however, youth e-cigarette use is a critical public health concern. Many young people who try e-cigarettes remain e-cigarette users. In 2023, about half of students who had ever used e-cigarettes were still using them. Over 2.1 million US middle and high school students (7.7%) reported currently using e-cigarettes in 2023.\n\nCDC also provides resources to help parents, educators, health care providers, and other youth influencers talk to young people about the dangers of tobacco products. CDC's activities include:\n\nWorking with all 50 states and the District of Columbia to support state and community activities to prevent use of tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, among youth and young adults.\n\nDeveloping easy-to-understand materials using the best available science.\n\nUsing digital and social media platforms to create and deliver information where young people and youth influencers seek information.\n\nOur impact\n\nFrom 2012\u20132018, the Tips\u00ae campaign motivated more than 16 million U.S. adults to make a quit attempt. One million U.S. adults successfully quit smoking. Tips prevented an estimated 129,000 early deaths and helped save an estimated $7.3 billion in smoking-related health care costs.\n\nCDC, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, implements the National Youth Tobacco Survey to provide national data on youth tobacco product use. Federal, national, and state partners use these data to design, implement, and evaluate youth tobacco prevention and control programs.\n\nLeadership Bio\n\nDr. Kittner leads the Office on Smoking and Health\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

Los cuidados para el c\u00e1ncer cuestan $185 mil millones cada a\u00f1o. El c\u00e1ncer es la segunda causa principal de muerte en el pa\u00eds, pero m\u00e1s de la mitad de las muertes por c\u00e1ncer probablemente se podr\u00edan prevenir al reducir las causas del c\u00e1ncer y al aumentar las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n y la administraci\u00f3n de vacunas.\n\nLa Divisi\u00f3n de Prevenci\u00f3n y Control del C\u00e1ncer trabaja para reducir los factores que aumentan el riesgo de c\u00e1ncer, y promueve las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n de c\u00e1ncer. Estas actividades ayudan a que cada persona tenga igualdad de oportunidades de obtener la mejor salud posible.\n\nPrioridades\n\nRecolectar datos sobre los casos y tratamientos del c\u00e1ncer.\n\nLa Divisi\u00f3n de Prevenci\u00f3n y Control del C\u00e1ncer dirige el Programa Nacional de Registros del C\u00e1ncer y coordina con otras agencias federales para recolectar datos sobre casi todos los casos de c\u00e1ncer en los Estados Unidos. Estos datos se usan para ayudar a guiar los esfuerzos a fin de prevenir el c\u00e1ncer y detectarlo de forma temprana.\n\nLos datos del Programa Nacional de Registros del C\u00e1ncer se pueden usar para responder preguntas como las siguientes:\n\n\u00bfHay m\u00e1s o menos personas con c\u00e1ncer de colon este a\u00f1o, en comparaci\u00f3n con el a\u00f1o pasado?\n\n\u00bfHay mujeres en ciertas \u00e1reas geogr\u00e1ficas con m\u00e1s probabilidades de presentar c\u00e1ncer de mama en etapa tard\u00eda, cuando es m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil de tratar?\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 grupos de personas tienen m\u00e1s probabilidades de tener c\u00e1ncer de piel?\n\nPromueva las pruebas de c\u00e1ncer colorrectal\n\nEl c\u00e1ncer colorrectal es una de las causas principales de muerte por c\u00e1ncer en los Estados Unidos, pero no tiene por qu\u00e9 ser as\u00ed. Las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer colorrectal pueden encontrar p\u00f3lipos precancerosos (crecimiento de tejido an\u00f3malo en el colon o el recto) para que sean extirpados antes de que se conviertan en c\u00e1ncer. Las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n tambi\u00e9n ayudan a encontrar el c\u00e1ncer colorrectal en sus primeras etapas, cuando el tratamiento es m\u00e1s eficaz.\n\nEl Programa de Control del C\u00e1ncer Colorrectal de los CDC financia 20 estados, 8 universidades, 2 organizaciones tribales y 5 organizaciones m\u00e1s para aumentar las tasas de pruebas de detecci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer colorrectal en las personas de 45 a 75 a\u00f1os.\n\nPromueva las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n del c\u00e1ncer de mama y de cuello uterino\n\nHacerse mamograf\u00edas, pruebas de Papanicol\u00e1u y del virus del papiloma humano (VPH) de manera regular puede reducir su riesgo de morir por el c\u00e1ncer de mama o de cuello uterino. Estas pruebas pueden encontrar el c\u00e1ncer en una etapa temprana, cuando el tratamiento es m\u00e1s eficaz. Las pruebas de detecci\u00f3n de c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino tambi\u00e9n pueden prevenir el c\u00e1ncer al encontrar lesiones precancerosas (crecimiento de tejido an\u00f3malo) antes de que se convierta en c\u00e1ncer.\n\nEl Programa Nacional de Detecci\u00f3n Temprana del C\u00e1ncer de Mama y de Cuello Uterino (NBCCEDP) de los CDC otorga fondos a los 50 estados, el Distrito de Columbia, Puerto Rico, 5 islas del Pac\u00edfico afiliadas a los EE. UU. y 13 tribus u organizaciones tribales. Estos programas proporcionan servicios para la detecci\u00f3n y el diagn\u00f3stico del c\u00e1ncer de mama y de cuello uterino a mujeres de bajos ingresos y con seguro m\u00e9dico insuficiente o sin seguro. Las mujeres que reciban un diagn\u00f3stico de c\u00e1ncer a trav\u00e9s del Programa Nacional de Detecci\u00f3n Temprana del C\u00e1ncer de Mama y de Cuello Uterino podr\u00edan reunir los requisitos para recibir tratamiento a trav\u00e9s del programa Medicaid.\n\nOtorgar fondos a los estados para prevenir y controlar el c\u00e1ncer\n\nEl Programa Nacional de Control Integral del C\u00e1ncer (NCCCP) de los CDC otorga fondos a los 50 estados, el Distrito de Columbia, 7 territorios y estados libres asociados de los EE. UU., y 7 tribus u organizaciones tribales para lo siguiente:\n\nCrear grupos de colaboradores que compartan recursos y conocimientos para combatir el c\u00e1ncer.\n\nUsar datos de registros del c\u00e1ncer, encuestas de factores de riesgo del comportamiento y otros recursos a fin de aprender cu\u00e1les c\u00e1nceres y factores de riesgo afectan m\u00e1s a sus comunidades.\n\nMejorar el acceso a la detecci\u00f3n y el tratamiento.\n\nReducir los factores de riesgo del c\u00e1ncer y mejorar los desenlaces del c\u00e1ncer para grupos afectados por disparidades en la salud.\n\nResponder a las necesidades f\u00edsicas, financieras y emocionales de los sobrevivientes de c\u00e1ncer y sus familias.\n\nAyudar a educar a las personas acerca del c\u00e1ncer.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a Muestre su Valent\u00eda educa a las mujeres menores de 45 a\u00f1os sobre el c\u00e1ncer de mama. La campa\u00f1a comparte historias de la vida real para inspirar a las mujeres j\u00f3venes a aprender sobre su riesgo de c\u00e1ncer de mama y a hablar con su m\u00e9dico acerca de c\u00f3mo reducirlo.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a Conozca su cuerpo: inf\u00f3rmese sobre los c\u00e1nceres ginecol\u00f3gicos de los CDC aumenta la concientizaci\u00f3n entre las mujeres y los profesionales m\u00e9dicos sobre los cinco tipos principales de c\u00e1ncer ginecol\u00f3gico: de cuello uterino, de ovario, de \u00fatero, de vagina y de vulva.\n\nLa campa\u00f1a Screen for Life: Campa\u00f1a Nacional de Acci\u00f3n contra el C\u00e1ncer Colorrectal aumenta la concientizaci\u00f3n sobre la importancia de hacer pruebas de detecci\u00f3n de c\u00e1ncer colorrectal.\n\nNuestro impacto\n\nDesde 1991, los programas financiados por el Programa Nacional de Control Integral del C\u00e1ncer han proporcionado m\u00e1s de 16 millones de pruebas de detecci\u00f3n de c\u00e1ncer de mama y de cuello uterino. Estas pruebas han encontrado casi 78 000 casos de c\u00e1ncer de mama y m\u00e1s de 5000 casos de c\u00e1ncer de cuello uterino.\n\nEl Programa Nacional de Control Integral del C\u00e1ncer re\u00fane organizaciones para crear planes a fin de ayudar a reducir la cantidad de personas afectadas por el c\u00e1ncer.

Read about some of our accomplishments and the impact they\u2019re having on our country\u2019s health.\n\nOverview\n\nAs we look back on 2024, it\u2019s my pleasure to recognize just a few of our exceptional accomplishments. This work reflects our ongoing commitment to preventing chronic diseases, addressing health disparities, and improving the health and well-being of communities across the country.\n\nTackling Maternal Mortality by Turning Data into Action\n\nMore than 80% of maternal deaths in the United States are preventable, underscoring the urgency of addressing maternal mortality head-on, and that\u2019s exactly what NCCDPHP is doing.\n\nIn 2024, CDC committed $118 to the ERASE Maternal Mortality program, empowering maternal mortality review committees (MMRCs) in 46 states and 6 territories across the nation. These committees collect data and review individual cases of maternal mortality to identify areas of systems improvement. Already, we\u2019re seeing results. For instance:\n\nGeorgia hemorrhage monitoring program is helping hospitals detect and respond to postpartum bleeding faster, preventing unnecessary deaths.\n\nTennessee substance use screening program is expanding access to care for pregnant women facing substance use challenges, improving outcomes for both parents and babies.\n\nThis integral work is preventing deaths and building systems that protect mothers and families. Through these investments and collaborations, we\u2019re creating a future where preventable maternal deaths no longer occur.\n\nImproving Youth Mental Health Through Schools\n\nIn 2024, CDC's Division of Adolescent and School Health (DASH) became the 9th division in our Center unifying adolescent and school health efforts. The division made big strides this year to address youth mental health. In 2024, DASH\u2019s newly released School Mental Health Action Guide was downloaded over 14,000 times.\n\nAdditionally, our premier adolescent health survey, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey data demonstrated a downward trend in adolescents reporting sadness, highlighting the importance of targeted school-based health efforts.\n\nAddressing Maternal Hypertension, A Leading Cause of Black Maternal Deaths\n\nThrough maternal mortality review committees, we learned that nearly half of preventable maternal deaths are linked to heart disease and hypertension. In response, CDC's Million Hearts\u00ae Initiative collaborated with clinical organizations to develop the Hypertension in Pregnancy Change Package .\n\nThis resource equips outpatient care teams with strategies to improve the diagnosis and management of hypertension during and after pregnancy. Within just six months of its release, more than 200 clinicians and numerous health systems began implementing its strategies to improve outcomes for pregnant women nationwide.\n\nNew Interactive Maps to Address Social Needs and Chronic Disease Locally\n\nIn 2024, we released new Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data faster than ever before. The self-reported behaviors are important for monitoring chronic disease at the state level and across the U.S. For the first time, BRFSS data included information on social needs, like access to healthy foods, housing stability, and transportation. This timely release of data helps all 50 states to evaluate public health needs and programs, often serving as the only statewide source of data on adult health and risk behaviors.\n\nMaking it local\n\nIn August 2024, CDC released the PLACES (or Population Level Analysis and Community Estimates) data, allowing individual, clinicians, and policymakers to explore BRFSS information at the local level through the interactive website, maps, and visualizations. Using this data, CDC published multiple papers exploring social needs, including mammography access and racial and ethnic disparities, related to chronic disease and health outcomes, empowering communities to take informed action.\n\nReducing Youth Tobacco Use: Major Declines in Youth Cigarette and E-Cigarette Use\n\nIn November 2024, the 35th Report of the Surgeon General on tobacco was released, focusing on tobacco-related disparities. Developed with support from the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH), the report is a reflection of the collaboration of hundreds of scientists within and outside CDC.\n\nEvidence from the report is already informing decisionmakers, including action to restrict the sale of flavored tobacco products in states and communities. This progress coincides with significant declines in youth tobacco use: cigarette use reached the lowest level ever at 1.4%, and e-cigarette use dropped to 5.9% - the lowest in a decade.\n\nInvesting in Tribal Communities to Reduce Chronic Disease\n\nIn 2024, CDC's Good Health and Wellness in Indian Country (GHWIC) program awarded almost $21 million to 28 tribes, tribal organizations, and urban Indian organizations. These grants support culturally responsive, community-driven, evidence-based strategies to reduce chronic diseases and their risk factors.\n\nThis funding has reached over 375,000 American Indian and Alaska Native community members with programming focused on smoking cessation, improved nutrition, physical activity, breastfeeding support, and heart disease and stroke prevention.\n\nNational Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (NCCDPHP)\n\nCDC's work to prevent chronic diseases across the lifespan and help people manage their chronic diseases to prevent complications.\n\nDivisions and Offices\n\nAbout Us\n\nChronic Disease Interventions\n\nBudget and Funding\n\nOur Impact\n\nSocial Media Resources",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, NCCDPHP added new guidelines, resources, and approaches to help people make healthy choices and reduce the likelihood of getting a chronic disease.\n\nGuidelines for dental settings\n\nNCCDPHP worked with CDC's COVID-19 response to issue interim guidance to keep patients and staff safe in dental settings and later adapted the guidelines for use with school sealant programs for children. The guidance for dental settings made several important recommendations for personal protective equipment and ventilation.\n\nMental health campaign\n\nNCCDPHP launched an award-winning national communications campaign called How Right Now/Qu\u00e9 Hacer Ahora in 2020 to provide tailored mental health resources for people with chronic stress, grief, and loss related to the pandemic. Evaluation findings from the first year showed that the campaign increased resilience, use of self-care strategies, and community engagement for the people most in need, including African American, Hispanic/Latino, and American Indian/Alaska Native people as well as those experiencing violence or economic distress. Campaign reach from August 2020 through May 2021 was about 28 million. In 2022, the campaign added new priority groups, such as school staff and teachers.\n\nEmergency preparedness for pregnant women and infants\n\nNCCDPHP worked with the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs to develop a preparedness checklist to serve as a framework for local, state, tribal and territorial emergency planning. The checklist increases the capacity of all U.S. jurisdictions to ensure that the needs of women of reproductive age, especially pregnant and postpartum women, and infants are addressed in emergency planning activities like the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVaccine promotion in the communities most affected\n\nIn October 2020, NCCDPHPs Racial and Ethnic Approached to Community Health (REACH) program partnered with CDC's Immunization Services Division to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in adult vaccination coverage for both COVID-19 and influenza. Thirty-eight current REACH recipients were awarded funds to implement community-focused COVID-19 and flu vaccination promotional activities aiming to increase vaccine awareness, access, and confidence.\n\nBecause of its established community relationships, the REACH program was well-positioned to share messages about increased risk of severe COVID-19 in racial and ethnic minority groups. As a result of these funded activities, 162,157 community members were vaccinated over 12 months.\n\nFunding to train community health workers\n\nIn August 2021, NCCDPHP developed the Community Health Workers for COVID Response and Resilient Communities initiative (CCR) to strengthen the public health workforce, slow the spread of COVID-19, and move toward health equity.\n\nCommunity health workers, as trusted members of the communities they serve, connect people to care and address barriers to care. NCCDPHP awarded grants to more than 67 state, tribal, local, and territorial entities to train, deploy, and engage CHWs to address health disparities in the communities that have been hit hardest by COVID-19.\n\nSince its launch in August 2021, CCR initiative has trained over 2,000 CHWs in COVID-19 response efforts. Award recipients supported the integration of CHWs into nearly 2,000 organizations and developed over 500 new partnerships to enhance CHW efforts. CHWs supported over 5,900 vaccination events, including pop-up clinics, and reached over 16.9 million community members with education and messaging. CHWs also made over 400,000 referrals to social services, including referrals for food and nutrition services, housing and shelter services, and public health insurance or other benefits to cover health care costs.\n\nVirtual delivery of Diabetes Prevention Program\n\nFrom March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2021, CDC staff shared guidance and resources to help more than half of the CDC-recognized organizations (n=806) that were previously delivering the National DPP lifestyle change program in person to deliver a percentage of their class sessions virtually. This included both training and information on distance learning platforms and lifestyle coach training materials to help others in the National DPP community to continue to offer the program.\n\nNCCDPHP will continue to assess these efforts to better understand what is most effective for improving access to information, healthy behaviors, and care so people can stay well. Better overall health not only improves people's quality of life but may decrease their risk for severe illness when public health emergencies happen.\n\nUnderlying medical conditions associated with higher risk for severe COVID-19: information for healthcare professionals.

    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/priorities/diabetes-interventions.html": "Health and Economic Benefits of Diabetes Interventions\n\nAt a glance\n\nMore than 38 million Americans of all ages have diabetes, and 98 million adults are at high risk.\n\nDiabetes is the most expensive chronic condition in the United States.\n\nLifestyle changes and good self-care can help people stay well and avoid costly complications.\n\nDiabetes in the United States\n\nCurrent estimates show that 1 in 3 Americans will develop diabetes sometime in their lifetime. 1 Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how the body turns food into energy and results in too much sugar in the bloodstream. Over time, this can cause serious health problems and damage vital organs. Most people who have diabetes have a shorter life expectancy than people without the disease.\n\nQuick facts\n\n38 million people of all ages (about 11.6% of the population) have diabetes. 2\n\n98 million adults (38%) have prediabetes, blood sugar levels that are higher than normal but not high enough to be diagnosed as diabetes. 2\n\nDiabetes complications are increasing for young adults aged 18 to 44 and middle-aged adults aged 45 to 64. 3\n\nDiabetes is more common among American Indian or Alaska Native, non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian people than non-Hispanic White people.\n\nNearly 1 in 5 adolescents aged 12 to 18 and 1 in 4 young adults aged 19 to 34 have prediabetes. 4\n\nThe high cost of diabetes\n\nThe total annual cost of diabetes in the United States is $413 billion, A making it the most expensive chronic condition in our nation. 5 6\n\n$1 out of every $4 in U.S. health care costs is spent on caring for people with diabetes. 5\n\n$307 billion A is spent each year on direct medical costs and another $106 billion A on reduced productivity. 5\n\n61% of diabetes costs are for adults aged 65 or older, which is mainly paid by Medicare. 5\n\nAmong Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 or older with type 2 diabetes, the estimated median costs associated with diabetes complications is $5,876 per person each year. 7\n\n48% to 64% of lifetime medical costs for a person with diabetes are for complications related to diabetes, such as heart disease and stroke. 8\n\nStrategies that work\n\nCDC is working to help millions of Americans reduce their risk of type 2 diabetes and prevent or delay serious diabetes complications, which will save lives and lower medical costs.\n\nPreventing type 2 diabetes\n\nWhile some risk factors for type 2 diabetes, such as family history or age, cannot be changed, others can be avoided by maintaining a healthy weight and being physically active. To help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes, CDC's National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP) delivers an affordable, evidence-based lifestyle change program. Studies show that the lifestyle change program, which focuses on healthy eating and physical activity, can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes by more than 50% for people at high risk. CDC and its partners are working to make the lifestyle change program available to more Americans. More than 750,000 adults had participated as of March 2024.\n\nTo make more people aware of their risk of prediabetes, CDC partnered with the American Diabetes Association, American Medical Association, and Ad Council to launch the first national prediabetes awareness campaign . The campaign includes a 1-minute online risk test and links people to organizations across the country that deliver the National DPP lifestyle change program. More than 12 million people now know their prediabetes risk as a result.\n\nPreventing diabetes complications\n\nTo prevent complications in people living with diabetes, CDC and its partners are working to expand access to and participation in diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) services .\n\nDSMES services reach over 1 million people with diabetes each year. DSMES services help people with diabetes effectively manage their blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol and get preventive care. Keeping diabetes under control through effective disease management can lower risks of diabetes complications. For example:\n\nEffective blood sugar management can reduce the risk of eye disease, kidney disease, and nerve disease by 40%. 9\n\nBlood pressure management can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke by 33% to 50%. 10 Improved cholesterol levels can reduce cardiovascular complications by 20% to 50%. 11\n\nRegular eye exams and timely treatment could prevent up to 90% of diabetes-related blindness. 12\n\nHealth care services that include regular foot exams and patient education could prevent up to 85% of diabetes-related amputations. 13\n\nDetecting and treating early diabetic kidney disease by using kidney protective medicines that lower blood pressure can reduce decline in kidney function by 33% to 37%. 14\n\nBenefits of using proven strategies\n\nMany effective diabetes prevention and management strategies are a good value in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. Public health interventions that cost less than $50,000 per QALY are widely accepted as being good value or cost-effective.\n\nIntensive lifestyle modification to prevent type 2 diabetes among people at high risk costs $12,500 A per QALY, compared to no intervention. 15\n\nSelf-monitoring of blood sugar levels three times a day by people with type 2 diabetes on insulin costs $3,700 A per QALY compared to self-monitoring once a day. 16\n\nScreening for eye complications every 1 to 2 years costs $8,763 A per QALY compared to no screening. 16\n\nAnnual screening for chronic kidney disease costs $21,000 B per QALY compared to no screening. 17\n\nCosts were measured in 2017 U.S. dollars.\n\nCosts were measured in 2006 U.S. dollars. Older cost estimates are likely to be underestimates.\n\nKoyama AK, Cheng YJ, Brinks R, et. al. Trends in lifetime risk and years of potential life lost from diabetes in the United States, 1997-2018.

Healthy lifestyle behaviors\u2014like eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables and low in sodium and being physically active\u2014can help prevent high blood pressure.\n\nQuick facts\n\nNearly half of U.S. adults (119.9 million) have high blood pressure, and most of them (94.9 million) are recommended lifestyle modifications and prescription medication. 1\n\n3 in 4 adults with high blood pressure (92 million) do not have it under control, defined as less than 130/80 mm Hg. 1\n\nHigh blood pressure rates vary by race and ethnicity. Over half (58%) of non-Hispanic Black adults, 49% of non-Hispanic White adults, 45% of non-Hispanic Asian adults, and 39% of Hispanic adults in the United States have high blood pressure. 1\n\nAbout 83% of non-Hispanic Black adults, 75% of non-Hispanic White adults, 82% of non-Hispanic Asian adults, and 83% of Hispanic adults with high blood pressure do not have it under control. 2\n\nIn 2022, high blood pressure was a primary or contributing cause of 685,875 deaths in the United States. 3\n\nThe high cost of high blood pressure\n\nAnnual costs associated with high blood pressure were an estimated $219 billion in the United States in 2019. 4 Because high blood pressure affects so many Americans, it is one of our nation's costliest health conditions.\n\nAnnual medical costs for people with high blood pressure were $2,759 higher than for people without high blood pressure in 2019. 4 In a large convenience sample of privately insured adults who sought outpatient care, annual medical costs were $2,926 higher for those with high blood pressure than those without in 2021. 5\n\nAs a preventable and treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure it is a large contributor to increased health care costs. About 1 in every 8 health care dollars is spent on cardiovascular disease (about 12% in 2019\u20132020). 6 Cardiovascular disease drives substantial Medicare costs. In 2018, national per-capita Medicare costs for all fee-for-service beneficiaries living with heart disease or surviving a stroke were $19,693 and $31,882, respectively. 7\n\nAbout 1 in every 8 health care dollars is spent on cardiovascular disease (about 12% in 2019\u20132020). 6\n\nCardiovascular disease drives substantial Medicare costs. In 2018, national per-capita Medicare costs for all fee-for-service beneficiaries living with heart disease or surviving a stroke were $19,693 and $31,882, respectively. 7\n\nStrategies that work\n\nCDC supports state, local, tribal, and territorial heart disease and stroke prevention programs that help millions of Americans control their high blood pressure and reduce other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. The agency promotes strategies and policies that encourage healthy lifestyles and behaviors, healthy environments and communities, and access to early and affordable detection and treatment of high blood pressure. These evidence-based strategies help save lives and reduce health care costs. The strategies include:\n\nExpanding the use of team-based care, which means health care professionals work with pharmacists, community health workers, and other health professionals to manage patients' high blood pressure. 8 9\n\nExpanding the use of community health workers to connect people with the services and lifestyle programs they need to reduce their blood pressure. 10\n\nIncreasing the use of self-measured blood pressure monitoring, where people with high blood pressure check their own blood pressure regularly and share this information with their health care provider. 11 12\n\nImprovements in high blood pressure control could save lives and billions in health care costs every year. For example:\n\nUsing team-based care that includes a pharmacist could prevent up to 91,900 heart attacks, 139,000 strokes, and 115,400 cardiovascular deaths over 5 years among U.S. adults with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Medicare could save up to $900 million over 5 years with this intervention. 9\n\nAdopting self-measured blood pressure monitoring programs could reduce heart attacks by 4.9% and strokes by 3.8%, and could generate $7,794 average savings in health care costs per person over 20 years. 13\n\nCompared to standard treatment, self-measured blood pressure monitoring would yield a return on investment of $7.50 to $19.34 per $1 spent over 10 years. 12\n\nFor more information about strategies to prevent heart disease and stroke, see Best Practices for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Programs and Hypertension Control Change Package for Clinicians .\n\nBenefits of using proven strategies\n\nMany effective strategies to manage high blood pressure are a good value in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained.* For example:\n\nTeam-based care to improve blood pressure control has a median cost of $16,309 (in 2023 dollar value) per QALY gained. 14 15\n\nThe use of community health workers, as part of a team, has a median estimated cost of $20,642 (in 2023 dollar value) per QALY gained. 9 15\n\nWhen used with other approaches, self-measured blood pressure monitoring has a median cost of $3,305 to $12,749 (in 2023 dollar value) per QALY gained. 10 15\n\n* Public health interventions that cost less than $50,000 per QALY are widely considered cost-effective.\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/priorities/oral-disease.html": "Health and Economic Benefits of Oral Disease Interventions\n\nAt a glance\n\nOral diseases like cavities and gum disease cause pain and disability for millions of Americans.\n\nCDC promotes effective interventions, including dental sealants and community water fluoridation, to prevent cavities and save money.\n\nOral diseases in the United States\n\nOral diseases \u2014which range from cavities to gum disease to oral cancer\u2014cause pain and disability for millions of Americans. 1 Cavities (also called tooth decay) are one of the most common chronic conditions in the United States. Non-Hispanic Black people, Hispanic people, and American Indian and Alaska Native people generally have the poorest oral health compared to other U.S. racial and ethnic groups. 2\n\nQuick facts\n\nBy age 9, half of children have had cavities in their primary (baby) or permanent teeth. 1 in 10 adolescents aged 12 to 19 have at least one untreated cavity. 2\n\n1 in 5 adults aged 20 to 64 years have untreated cavities, 2 and nearly half of those aged 30 or older show signs of gum disease. 3 If left untreated, these conditions can lead to tooth loss.\n\nMore than 1 in 7 older adults have lost all their teeth. 2\n\nNearly 3 in 10 older adults who currently smoke have lost all their teeth, compared to about 1 in 10 older adults who never smoked. 2\n\nThe high cost of oral diseases\n\nAnnual costs for dental care in the United States is $136 billion. 4 A\n\nOn average, over 34 million school hours are lost each year because of unplanned (emergency) dental care. 5\n\nAlmost $46 billion B is lost in productivity in the United States each year because of untreated oral disease. 6\n\nIn 2017, there were 2.1 million emergency room visits for dental emergencies. Medicaid pays for about 69% of these visits for children and about 40% for adults. 7\n\nDuring 1996\u20132013, $26.5 billion B was spent on dental care for children and adolescents. About 70% of this total was used for preventive services, such as general exams and cleanings, X-rays, and orthodontic treatment (such as braces). 8\n\nNearly 18% of working-age adults report that the appearance of their mouth and teeth affects their ability to interview for a job. For people with low incomes, the percentage increases to 29%. 9\n\nStrategies that work\n\nCDC works to improve the nation's oral health by reducing disparities in the rate of cavities and integrating oral health programs into chronic disease prevention and medical care. The agency and its partners promote effective interventions, including dental sealants and community water fluoridation, which are strongly recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force because they prevent cavities and save money.\n\nDental sealants are a quick, easy, and painless way to prevent most of the cavities that children get in their permanent back teeth, where 9 in 10 cavities occur.\n\nSchool sealant programs provide dental sealants at no charge to children who are less likely to receive private dental care. Almost 1 million cavities have been prevented in children from low-income households as a result of dental sealants.\n\nCommunity water fluoridation is an effective way to deliver fluoride to all community members regardless of age, education, or income. It also saves money for families and the U.S. health care system. 10\n\nCDC is working to meet the Healthy People 2030 objective of 77.1% of the U.S. population being on community water systems with the recommended amount of fluoride. Currently, 72.3% of the population served by community water systems (more than 209 million people) drink water that contains enough fluoride to protect their teeth. 11\n\nThe effectiveness of dental sealants\u200e\n\nBenefits of using proven strategies\n\nThe benefits of school sealant programs are greater than their cost when they serve children at high risk for tooth decay. These programs become cost-saving after 2 years and save more than $11 C for every tooth sealed over 4 years. 12\n\nProviding sealants to the nearly 7 million children from low-income households who need them could save up to $300 million C in averted dental treatment costs. 13\n\nOne year of providing fluoridated water is estimated to save $6.5 billion D in averted direct and indirect treatment costs. 14\n\nCommunities served by fluoridated water save an average of $32 D per person a year by avoiding treatment for cavities. Communities of 1,000 or more see an average estimated return on investment of $20 for every $1 spent on water fluoridation. 14\n\nThe U.S. health care system could save up to $100 million E a year if dental offices screened patients for diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol and referred them for treatment. 15\n\nCosts measured in 2018 U.S. dollars.\n\nCosts measured in 2015 U.S. dollars.

    "https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/priorities/tobacco-use.html": "Health and Economic Benefits of Tobacco Use Interventions\n\nAt a glance\n\nTobacco use is the leading preventable cause of disease, disability, and death in the United States.\n\nIn 2018, cigarette smoking cost the United States over $600 billion.\n\nCDC works to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco products, eliminate secondhand smoke exposure, help people quit, and eliminate disparities in tobacco use.\n\nTobacco use in the United States\n\nCommercial* tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States. 1 Cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body and causes many diseases, including cancer, heart disease stroke, lung diseases, type 2 diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nSecondhand smoke also causes stroke, lung cancer, and heart disease in adults. Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, slowed lung growth, acute respiratory infections, respiratory symptoms, middle ear disease, and more frequent and severe asthma. 1\n\n* \"Commercial tobacco\" means harmful products that are made and sold by tobacco companies. It does not include \"traditional tobacco\" used by Indigenous groups for religious or ceremonial purposes.\n\nQuick facts\n\nAbout 28 million U.S. adults smoke cigarettes, 2 and 58 million nonsmoking Americans are exposed to secondhand smoke. 3\n\nCigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths every year in the U.S., including 41,000 deaths from secondhand smoke. 1\n\nFor every American who dies because of smoking, at least 30 are living with a serious smoking-related illness. That's more than 16 million Americans. 1 4\n\nDisparities related to commercial tobacco use, secondhand smoke exposure, and quitting exist across population groups. For example, American Indian and Alaska Native people have the highest prevalence of cigarette smoking compared to other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. 2\n\nIn 2021, 21.5% of adult Medicaid enrollees currently smoked cigarettes, compared to 8.6% of adults with private health insurance. 2\n\nThe high cost of tobacco use\n\nCigarette smoking cost the United States more than $600 billion in 2018, 5 including:\n\nMore than $240 billion A in health care spending. 6\n\nNearly $185 billion A in lost productivity from smoking-related illnesses and health conditions. 6\n\nNearly $180 billion A in lost productivity from smoking-related premature death. 6\n\n$7 billion B in lost productivity from premature death from secondhand smoke exposure. 7\n\nStrategies that work\n\nCDC is committed to advancing health equity by reducing diseases and deaths caused by commercial tobacco use in all communities. These efforts can also help reduce smoking-related costs.\n\nCDC and its partners work to prevent youth from starting to use tobacco products, eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke, help people quit, and reduce health disparities for groups at higher risk of chronic diseases caused by smokinghealth inequities and disparities related to tobacco product use.\n\nFor example, CDC's National and State Tobacco Control Program is the only nationwide initiative for comprehensive tobacco prevention and control efforts that supports all 50 states, the District of Columbia, 8 U.S. territories, and 26 tribes and tribal organizations.\n\nCDC efforts have protected Americans from the risks of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure. For example:\n\nCDC's Tips From Former Smokers \u00ae ( Tips \u00ae) campaign is the first federally funded tobacco education campaign focused on motivating U.S. adults who smoke to quit. Tips features real people from diverse backgrounds who are living with serious long-term health effects from smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.\n\nCDC connects people who smoke with resources to help them quit, including a free quitline portal, 1-800-QUIT- NOW, which links callers to their state quitline, as well as web-based, text-based, and app-based quit support resources.\n\nThe percentage of the population covered by comprehensive state or local smoke-free laws has increased over the past 2 decades, with 62.7% of the U.S. population currently covered.\n\nCDC, states, territories, tribal organizations, and other partners have helped reduce cigarette smoking among U.S. adults from 20.9% (about 1 in every 5 adults) in 2005 to 11.5% (nearly 1 in every 9 adults) in 2021. 2\n\nEffectiveness of the Tips campaign\u200e\n\nBenefits of using proven strategies\n\nThe Community Preventive Services Task Force (CPSTF) reviews health interventions to determine which are evidence-based and cost-effective.* For example:\n\nComprehensive tobacco control programs are cost-effective, and savings from averted health care costs exceed intervention costs. 9\n\nA nationwide smokefree policy could save $700 to $1,297 C for each person not currently covered by a smokefree policy by preventing illness and reducing deaths from secondhand smoke exposure. 10\n\nInterventions that increase the price of tobacco products by 20% can save an average of $72 C per person per year in health care costs. 11\n\nMass-reach health communication interventions to change knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors affecting tobacco use. 12\n\n* The CPSTF considers interventions cost-effective if they cost less than $50,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained.\n\nCosts were measured in 2018 US dollars.\n\nCosts were measured in 2012 US dollars. Older cost estimates are likely to be underestimates.\n\nCosts were measured in 2011 US dollars. Older cost estimates are likely to be underestimates.\n\nUS Department of Health and Human Services.
